## 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Prepare for GitHub
```bash
# Initialize git repository (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - PDF Content Moderator"

# Add your GitHub repository
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway
1. **Create Railway Account**: Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign up
2. **New Project**: Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Select Repository**: Choose your pdf_content_moderator repository
4. **Auto-Deploy**: Railway will automatically detect Python and deploy using:
   - `Procfile` for startup command
   - `requirements.txt` for dependencies
   - `railway.json` for configuration

### Step 3: Configure Railway Settings (Optional)
In your Railway dashboard:
- **Environment Variables**: Set `FLASK_ENV=production` if needed
- **Custom Domain**: Add your domain in Settings → Domains
- **Resources**: Upgrade to higher RAM plan if needed (4GB+ recommended)

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment
- Check logs in Railway dashboard for any issues
- Models will auto-download on first run (~2-4GB)
- First startup may take 2-3 minutes due to model loading

## 🧠 Models & Memory Requirements

### AI Models (Auto-downloaded on first run)
- **Florence-2**: ~1.5GB - Image captioning
- **CLIP**: ~500MB - Image-text similarity  
- **NSFW Detector**: ~200MB - Adult content detection
- **Sentence Transformers**: ~400MB - Text analysis

### Memory Requirements for Railway
- **Minimum**: 2GB RAM (Starter plan) - May work but slow
- **Recommended**: 4GB+ RAM (Developer plan) - Optimal performance
- **Professional**: 8GB+ RAM (Pro plan) - Best for high traffic

### Railway Plans Comparison
| Plan | RAM | CPU | Storage | Price |
|------|-----|-----|---------|--------|
| Starter | 512MB-8GB | Shared | 1GB | $5/month |
| Developer | Up to 8GB | Shared | 10GB | $20/month |
| Pro | Up to 32GB | Dedicated | 100GB | $50/month |

## 🔧 Railway Configuration Files

### `Procfile` (Already included)
```
web: python app.py
```

### `railway.json` (Already included)
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python app.py",

## 🔒 Security & Production Notes

- All sensitive files are in `.gitignore`
- Models are downloaded securely from HuggingFace
- No external API calls - everything runs on your instance
- Temporary files are auto-cleaned
- HTTPS enabled by default on Railway

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### For Railway Deployment
1. **Use CPU-only mode**: Models will run on CPU (GPU not available on Railway)
2. **Optimize batch sizes**: Configured for Railway's memory limits
3. **Model caching**: Models are cached after first download
4. **Concurrent processing**: Limited to prevent memory issues

### Processing Times on Railway
- **Small PDF (1-5 pages)**: 30-60 seconds
- **Medium PDF (6-20 pages)**: 2-4 minutes  
- **Large PDF (21+ pages)**: 5-10 minutes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Railway Deployment

### Common Issues
1. **Out of Memory**: Upgrade to Developer plan (4GB+ RAM)
2. **Build Timeout**: Models are large - first build may take 10-15 minutes
3. **Startup Timeout**: First startup loads models - may take 2-3 minutes
4. **Disk Space**: Models need ~3GB - ensure adequate storage

### Railway Deployment Logs
Check these in Railway dashboard:
- **Build Logs**: Model download progress
- **Deploy Logs**: Application startup
- **Application Logs**: Runtime errors and processing

### Performance Monitoring
Railway provides built-in monitoring for:
- Memory usage
- CPU usage  
- Request latency
- Error rates

## 📄 Usage After Deployment
